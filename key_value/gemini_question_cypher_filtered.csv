What are the titles of the top 3 movies with the most votes?,movies,"<explanation>
This Cypher query identifies the top 3 movies with the most votes and retrieves their titles.

1. **MATCH (m:Movie)**: This line starts by finding all nodes with the label ""Movie"" and assigning them the variable ""m.""
2. **WITH m, m.votes AS num_votes ORDER BY num_votes DESC LIMIT 3**: This line calculates the number of votes for each movie (m.votes) using the alias ""num_votes"" and orders the movies in descending order based on the number of votes. It then limits the result set to the top 3 movies.
3. **RETURN m.title AS title**: Finally, the query returns the title (m.title) of each of the top 3 movies using the alias ""title.""

This query effectively leverages the ""ORDER BY"" clause with the ""LIMIT"" keyword to retrieve the top movies based on the number of votes.

2. **Match Reviews:** For each of these movies, we find the reviews (`r:REVIEWED`) connected to them.
3. **Return Summaries:** Finally, we return the summaries (`r.summary`) of these reviews.

Which people are followed by both Keanu Reeves and Joel Silver?,movies,"<explanation>
To answer this question, we can start by finding the nodes representing Keanu Reeves and Joel Silver. We then identify all the people followed by Keanu and all the people followed by Joel. Finally, we find the intersection of these two groups - these are the people followed by both Keanu Reeves and Joel Silver.

1. **Find Keanu Reeves and Joel Silver**: We use MATCH clauses to find the nodes with the 'Person' label and the respective names.
2. **Find people they follow**: We use two separate MATCH clauses, one for each actor, to find the people they follow. We traverse the 'FOLLOWS' relationship outwards from the actor nodes.
3. **Find the intersection**: We use the WITH clause to pass the list of people followed by each actor to the next part of the query. We then use the `apoc.coll.intersection` function (from the APOC library) to find the people present in both lists.
4. **Return the result**: We return the `name` property of each person in the intersection.

What are the release years of movies produced by people born after 1945?,movies,"<explanation>
This Cypher query identifies the release years of movies produced by individuals born after 1945.

1. **MATCH Clause:** We start by matching two nodes connected by the `PRODUCED` relationship: `(p:Person)-[:PRODUCED]->(m:Movie)`. Here, `p` represents a Person node, and `m` represents a Movie node.

2. **WHERE Clause:** We filter the results to only include persons born after 1945 (`p.born > 1945`).

3. **RETURN Clause:** Finally, we return the distinct release years (`DISTINCT m.released`) of the movies produced by the filtered persons.

By combining these clauses, the query effectively identifies and returns the desired release years based on the specified criteria.

Who acted in movies directed by Lana Wachowski and released before 2005?,movies,"<explanation>
1. We need to find persons who acted in movies. So we start by matching `(:Person)-[:ACTED_IN]->(:Movie)`
2. We need to filter movies to those directed by ""Lana Wachowski"". So we extend our match to `(:Person)-[:ACTED_IN]->(:Movie)<-[:DIRECTED]-(:Person)` and add a WHERE clause to filter the director's name.
3. We need to find movies released before 2005. So we add another WHERE clause to filter by the `released` property of the movie.
4. Finally, we return the names of the actors.

```cypher
MATCH (actor:Person)-[:ACTED_IN]->(movie:Movie)<-[:DIRECTED]-(director:Person)
WHERE director.name = ""Lana Wachowski"" AND movie.released < 2005
RETURN DISTINCT actor.name
