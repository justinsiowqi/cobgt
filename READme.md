# CoBGT: Combination of BERT, GraphSAGE, and Transformer Model

## Overview
This project is an implementation of the paper "Robust Text-to-Cypher Using Combination of BERT, GraphSAGE, and Transformer (CoBGT) Model." The [original paper](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/14/17/7881) proposes a novel technique to translate natural language text into cypher queries for the Neo4j graph database.
Please note that this paper was not authored by me, and the original authors did not provide a public GitHub repository for reference. The code in this repository represents my interpretation of the ideas from the paper, and as such, it may not be fully accurate or complete. It is an ongoing work, specifically focusing on the relation and properties prediction module.
